Mikes feedback for future improvement!

Looks really good! You could get a faster load time by looking into Netlify, AWS S3, or Github Pages for hosting this - since it is only the React front end, you don't need support for a server, and each of those services would give you much faster loads than Heroku provides and they all have free tiers as far as I know. The portfolio cards could be the same height, which I think would look better, or use more of a mosaic layout like Pinterest has - where the next item starts below the one on top instead of at the same horizontal line. Nicely done!
